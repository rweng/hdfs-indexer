/**
 *
 * This interface is the most abstract description of an index.
 * It usually contains one ore more storage structures to which data is written.
 *
 * The index is usually in a key-value format. There are two ways the index can be used:
 * First as primary index. In this case, the hdfs entry is completly stored in the index.
 * This would look like this:
 *
 * 25 => 2,Robin,25
 * 55 => 1,Franz,55
 * ...
 *
 * In the alternative case, a secondary index, only the position in the hdfs is stored:
 *
 * 22 => 4253564
 * 55 => 3452563
 *
 * Also, the implementation of indexes can differ.
 * Some indexes are adding values inline to the index storage, others
 * add seperate indexes and merge them together later.
 * Thus, this interface as to be as generic as possible.
 *
 * Note: It is important that opened indexes are closed. close() is the only method that
 * actually ensures that the data is persisted.
 *
